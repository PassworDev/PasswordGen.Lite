  <h2>Introduction to Internet Safety & Passwords</h2>
  <p>The internet is a powerful tool for learning, communication, and entertainment. However, it also comes with risks, such as hackers, scams, and identity theft. A strong password is your first line of defense against these threats. Think of your password as a key to a treasure chest containing your personal data. Weak passwords can be easily guessed, putting your information at risk. Learning password safety is essential for protecting your accounts. Throughout this class, you will gain practical skills to create strong passwords and stay safe online.</p>
  <div class="exercise"><strong>Mini Exercise:</strong> List three online accounts you use frequently and evaluate the strength of your current passwords.</div>
</div>

<!-- Page 2 -->
<div class="lesson-page" id="page2">
  <h2>Characteristics of Strong Passwords</h2>
  <p>A strong password should be long, ideally at least 12 characters. It should include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using predictable patterns or repeated characters. Do not include personal information such as your name or birthday. Strong passwords are hard to guess but easy for you to remember. Using complex combinations reduces the risk of your account being hacked. A password manager can help store these complex passwords securely.</p>
  <div class="exercise"><strong>Mini Exercise:</strong> Create two strong passwords for your accounts without using personal information.</div>
</div>

<!-- Page 3 -->
<div class="lesson-page" id="page3">
  <h2>Passphrases – Easy to Remember, Hard to Guess</h2>
  <p>Passphrases are sentences or combinations of words that are easier to remember than random characters. They are still very secure because they are long and unpredictable. For example, "BluePizzaRunsFast!2025" is easier to recall than "G7$kLp9#zR!2". Passphrases can include favorite things, numbers, and symbols. They are a great way to create strong passwords without relying solely on random characters. Using passphrases reduces the risk of forgetting your passwords. Remember to avoid common quotes or phrases that others could guess easily.</p>
  <div class="exercise"><strong>Mini Exercise:</strong> Make a passphrase using a favorite color, animal, and number.</div>
</div>

<!-- Page 4 -->
<div class="lesson-page" id="page4">
  <h2>Avoiding Personal Information in Passwords</h2>
  <p>Many people include birthdays, names, or pet names in passwords. Hackers can easily find this information on social media or public records. Using personal information makes your password weak and easy to guess. Instead, use abstract or random elements in your password. Combining unrelated words with numbers or symbols is more secure. Avoid patterns that others could predict. Think creatively when designing passwords to protect your personal data.</p>
  <div class="exercise"><strong>Mini Exercise:</strong> Review your passwords and rewrite any that include personal information.</div>
</div>

<!-- Page 5 -->
<div class="lesson-page" id="page5">
  <h2>The Danger of Reusing Passwords</h2>
  <p>Reusing the same password across multiple accounts is risky. If one account is compromised, all others using that password are at risk. Hackers often test stolen passwords on multiple sites. Unique passwords for each account reduce this risk. It is important to update passwords regularly. Using a password manager can simplify managing multiple strong passwords. Keeping passwords unique is a key step in online security.</p>
  <div class="exercise"><strong>Mini Exercise:</strong> Identify accounts that share the same password and plan to update them.</div>
</div>

<!-- Page 6 -->
<div class="lesson-page" id="page6">
  <h2>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h2>
  <p>Two-Factor Authentication adds an extra layer of security. Even if someone knows your password, they cannot access your account without a second verification. This can include codes sent via SMS, email, or an authenticator app. 2FA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access. Many online services support 2FA for free. It is highly recommended to enable it on all important accounts. Security apps like Google Authenticator or Authy make 2FA easy to use.</p>
  <div class="exercise"><strong>Mini Exercise:</strong> Enable 2FA on at least one account.</div>
</div>

<!-- Page 7 -->
<div class="lesson-page" id="page7">
  <h2>Recognizing Phishing Attacks</h2>
  <p>Phishing is when scammers attempt to trick you into giving personal information. It often comes as emails, messages, or pop-ups that appear legitimate. Phishing attacks may ask for passwords or credit card numbers. Always verify the sender and avoid clicking suspicious links. Check URLs carefully to ensure you are on legitimate sites. Being aware of phishing techniques helps prevent account compromise. Learning to recognize phishing is critical for online safety.</p>
  <div class="exercise"><strong>Mini Exercise:</strong> Identify a suspicious email and describe why it seems unsafe.</div>
</div>

<!-- Page 8 -->
<div class="lesson-page" id="page8">
  <h2>Safe Wi-Fi Practices</h2>
  <p>Public Wi-Fi can be risky for online security. Hackers can intercept data sent over unsecured networks. Avoid logging into sensitive accounts on public Wi-Fi. Using a trusted VPN protects your data by encrypting your connection. Always ensure the network you connect to is legitimate. Turn off file sharing and enable firewalls on your devices. Being careful on public Wi-Fi prevents personal information leaks.</p>
  <div class="exercise"><strong>Mini Exercise:</strong> Check your Wi-Fi settings and ensure your device is secure on public networks.</div>
</div>

<!-- Page 9 -->
<div class="lesson-page" id="page9">
  <h2>Recognizing Malware</h2>
  <p>Malware includes viruses, trojans, and spyware that can steal passwords and personal data. It often comes from downloads, links, or infected devices. Antivirus software can detect and remove malware. Keeping your system updated prevents many attacks. Avoid downloading unknown files or apps. Be cautious of pop-ups or emails that urge immediate action. Awareness of malware is key to keeping your devices safe.</p>
  <div class="exercise"><strong>Mini Exercise:</strong> Ensure your device has antivirus software installed and updated.</div>
</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page10">
  <h2>Safe Gaming Practices</h2>
  <p>Online gaming accounts are often targeted by hackers. Sharing login credentials is risky. Enable 2FA on gaming accounts to protect them. Use strong, unique passwords for each account. Be cautious of phishing attempts in chats or emails. Avoid clicking suspicious links in game messages. Staying secure in gaming environments helps protect personal data.</p>
  <div class="exercise"><strong>Mini Exercise:</strong> Review your gaming accounts and update passwords as needed.</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page11">
  <h2>Mobile Device Security</h2>
  <p>Mobile devices are easy targets for hackers. Using strong PINs or biometric locks helps secure them. Avoid public charging stations that may steal data. Keep your apps updated to prevent vulnerabilities. Install apps from trusted sources only. Review app permissions to protect sensitive information. Secure mobile devices are essential for overall digital safety.</p>
  <div class="exercise"><strong>Mini Exercise:</strong> Check your phone’s security settings and enable all protective measures.</div>

  <h2>Backup & Recovery</h2>
  <p>Regularly backing up files prevents data loss. Use cloud storage or external drives. Test recovery methods to ensure they work. Keep backups secure with strong passwords. Update backups after important changes. Being prepared reduces stress during emergencies. Protecting data is part of responsible online behavior.</p>
  <div class="exercise"><strong>Mini Exercise:</strong> Back up one important file safely.</div>
