<h2>Internet Safety Basics</h2>
<p>The internet is an amazing tool for learning, gaming, and connecting with friends. However, it also contains risks like scams, hacking, and malware. Personal information can be stolen if you are not careful. Strong passwords are your first line of defense to protect your accounts. Treat your passwords like the keys to your house. Never share them with strangers or untrusted sites. Being aware of risks helps you use the internet safely and confidently.</p>
<div class="exercise">Mini Exercise: List three online accounts you use and rate how strong your current passwords are.</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page2">
<h2>Why Passwords Matter</h2>
<p>Passwords are the gatekeepers of your online life. Weak passwords can easily be guessed by hackers using automated tools. Each online account should have a unique password to prevent unauthorized access. A strong password protects your personal messages, photos, and financial information. Passwords also prevent identity theft and scams. They are your first defense in a digital world full of threats. Always take time to create secure and memorable passwords for every account.</p>
</div>

<!-- Page 3 -->
<div class="lesson-page" id="page3">
<h2>Strong Password Rules</h2>
<p>A strong password is long and complex, ideally 12 or more characters. It should include uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using dictionary words, common phrases, or easily guessed information. A mix of unrelated words or phrases can make a password strong but still memorable. Examples include Blue!Tiger42Moon or Sun$Rise_2025!. Strong passwords take time for hackers to crack and greatly improve your online security. Always aim for uniqueness for every account.</p>
</div>

<!-- Page 4 -->
<div class="lesson-page" id="page4">
<h2>Common Password Mistakes</h2>
<p>Many people use weak passwords like "123456" or "password". Others include personal info like names, birthdays, or pets' names. Hackers often try these first. Reusing passwords across multiple accounts increases risk. Once one account is compromised, all others using that password are at risk. Avoid predictable patterns or sequences. Instead, focus on creating unique and complex passwords for every site.</p>
</div>

<!-- Page 5 -->
<div class="lesson-page" id="page5">
<h2>Risks of Reusing Passwords</h2>
<p>Using the same password for different accounts is very risky. Hackers can use a stolen password to try logging into other accounts. This is called credential stuffing. Reusing passwords makes all your accounts vulnerable at once. Always create unique passwords for each account. If remembering many passwords is difficult, consider using a password manager. This keeps your accounts safe and organized.</p>
</div>

<!-- Page 6 -->
<div class="lesson-page" id="page6">
<h2>Password Managers</h2>
<p>Password managers securely store all your passwords in one app. They can generate strong, complex passwords automatically. This reduces the need to remember multiple passwords. Examples include LastPass, 1Password, and Bitwarden. Password managers encrypt your data so only you can access it. They can also help you fill in passwords safely. Using a password manager is one of the easiest ways to stay secure online.</p>
</div>

<!-- Page 7 -->
<div class="lesson-page" id="page7">
<h2>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h2>
<p>Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security. Even if a hacker knows your password, they cannot log in without the second step. This may be a code sent to your phone or an authenticator app. 2FA is especially important for email, social media, and banking accounts. It prevents unauthorized access from stolen credentials. Always enable 2FA whenever available. This simple step drastically improves account safety.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page8">
<h2>Phishing Attacks</h2>
<p>Phishing tricks users into giving up personal information. Emails or messages often look official but are fake. Hackers may impersonate banks, schools, or friends. Always verify the sender and the website URL. Avoid clicking suspicious links or downloading attachments. Never enter passwords on unknown websites. Being cautious can prevent most phishing attacks.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page9">
<h2>Public Wi-Fi Risks</h2>
<p>Public Wi-Fi is convenient but often unsafe. Hackers can monitor the network and capture sensitive data. Avoid logging into banking or email accounts on public Wi-Fi. Using a trusted VPN encrypts your connection and protects your data. Only visit secure websites (HTTPS). Keep software and devices updated to prevent vulnerabilities. Be cautious when connecting to unknown networks.</p>
</div>

<div class="lesson-page" id="page10">
<h2>Secure Browsing</h2>
<p>Look for HTTPS and the padlock icon in website URLs. Avoid sites that appear suspicious or have poor grammar. Use updated browsers with security features. Enable pop-up blockers and safe browsing modes. Never enter personal information on unknown websites. Avoid downloading files from untrusted sources. Safe browsing protects your passwords and personal data.</p>
